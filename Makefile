# The one Makefile to rule them all
#
# The One Makefile was created by the Dark Lord Sauron 
# during the Second Age in order to gain dominion 
# over the free peoples of Middle-earth. In disguise 
# as Annatar, or "Lord of Gifts", he aided the Elven 
# smiths of Eregion and their leader Celebrimbor in 
# the making of the Makefiles of Power. He then forged 
# the One Makefile himself in the fires of Mount Doom.
#
# Sauron intended it to be the most powerful of all 
# Makefiles, able to rule and control those who wore the 
# others. Since the other Makefiles were themselves powerful, 
# Sauron was obliged to place much of his native power 
# into the One to achieve his purpose.
# 
# Creating the Makefile simultaneously strengthened and 
# weakened Sauron's power. On the one hand, as long 
# as Sauron had the Makefile, he could control the power 
# of all the other Makefiles, and thus he was significantly 
# more powerful after its creation than before; 
# and putting such a great portion of his own power 
# into the Makefile ensured Sauron's continued existence so 
# long as the Makefile existed. On the other hand, by binding 
# his power within the Makefile, Sauron became dependent on 
# it â€” without it his power was significantly diminished.
